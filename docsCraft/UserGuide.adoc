Welcome to **ndxCraft**, your distraction-free https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] editor. This guide will help you get started with the features and workflow of the application.

== Getting Started

=== Project Management
ndxCraft works with **Projects**, which are simply folders on your computer containing your AsciiDoc files.

. **Open a Project**: Click the **Projects** button (Folder icon) in the top toolbar.
. **Select a Folder**: Choose an existing project or click "Add Project" to mount a new folder from your system.
. **File Navigation**: Once a project is loaded, use the **Files** tab in the left sidebar to browse and open files.

=== The Interface

* **Toolbar**: Quick access to common formatting actions (Bold, Italic, Headings, etc.) and file operations.
* **Editor (Left/Center)**: The main writing area. It supports syntax highlighting for AsciiDoc.
* **Preview (Right)**: A real-time rendering of your document.
* **Sidebar (Left)**:
** **Files**: Your project file tree.
** **Structure**: A visual outline of your document. You can drag and drop sections here to reorder your content!

== Writing & Editing

=== Formatting
You can type AsciiDoc syntax directly or use the toolbar buttons.

* *Bold*: `*text*`
* _Italic_: `_text_`
* `Monospace`: `` `text` ``
* == Headings: `== Heading Level 2`

=== Distraction-Free Mode
* Press `F11` to toggle the entire app fullscreen.
* Press `F9` to focus solely on the **Code Editor**.
* Press `F10` to focus solely on the **Preview**.

=== Visual Editing (Experimental)
You can make quick text edits directly in the Preview pane!
. Toggle "Visual Edit" mode (Edit icon in the preview header).
. Click and type directly in the preview.
. Changes are synced back to the code editor.

== Advanced Features

=== AI Assistant
Click the **AI Assistant** button (or press `Ctrl+I`) to open the side panel. You can ask it to:
* Fix grammar
* Generate content
* Summarize text

=== Document Structure
The **Structure** tab parses your AsciiDoc headers.
* **Navigate**: Click a header to jump to that section.
